# Netflix GPT Clone

Welcome to the **Netflix GPT Clone**! This project mimics Netflix's recommendation system but adds a unique twist by using **GPT-based models** to provide personalized movie and TV recommendations based on natural language input. The frontend is built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, while the backend uses the **TMDB API** for fetching metadata and **OpenAI GPT** for generating recommendations. The project is deployed using **Firebase Hosting**.

## Features
